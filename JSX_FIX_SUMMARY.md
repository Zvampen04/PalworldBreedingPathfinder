# JSX Runtime Fix Summary

## Problem
The build was failing with the error:
```
"jsx" is not exported by "node_modules/react/jsx-runtime.js", imported by "src/components/ui/LoadingSpinner.tsx"
```

## Root Cause
The issue was a mismatch between the TypeScript JSX configuration and the Vite React plugin configuration. The project was using the new JSX transform (`react-jsx`) but the Vite plugin wasn't properly configured to handle it.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Vite Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)
Changed the React plugin configuration to use the classic JSX transform:
```typescript
plugins: [
  react({
    // Use classic JSX transform for better compatibility
    jsxRuntime: 'classic',
  }),
  // ... other plugins
]
```

### 2. Updated TypeScript Configuration (`tsconfig.json`)
Changed the JSX configuration to match:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react",
    // ... other options
  }
}
```

### 3. Ensured React Imports
Added explicit React import to `LoadingSpinner.tsx`:
```typescript
import React from 'react';
```

## Why This Fixes the Issue

1. **Classic JSX Transform**: Uses the traditional `React.createElement()` approach instead of the new JSX runtime
2. **Consistent Configuration**: Both TypeScript and Vite now use the same JSX transform method
3. **Better Compatibility**: The classic transform is more compatible with various build tools and environments
4. **Explicit React Import**: Ensures React is available for JSX transformation

## Testing
After these changes:
1. Run `npm run build` - should complete successfully
2. Run `npm run tauri build` - should build the Tauri app without JSX errors
3. The app should load properly in both dev and production modes

## Files Modified
- `vite.config.ts` - Updated React plugin configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - Updated JSX configuration
- `src/components/ui/LoadingSpinner.tsx` - Added React import

## Alternative Solutions Considered
1. **New JSX Transform**: Could have configured both TypeScript and Vite to use `react-jsx`, but this requires more complex configuration
2. **Manual JSX Runtime**: Could have manually configured the JSX runtime, but this is more error-prone
3. **Babel Configuration**: Could have added Babel, but this adds unnecessary complexity

The classic JSX transform was chosen for its simplicity and reliability.
