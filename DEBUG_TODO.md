# Debugging TODO: Module Loading Issue in Tauri Build

## Current Issue
The React app works in dev mode but fails to load in Tauri build mode. The module script (`index-Bjs-JW7R.js`) is accessible via fetch (200 OK) but fails to execute with a JavaScript error.

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Immediate Actions
- [ ] **Check browser console** for detailed JavaScript errors
- [ ] **Test with different browsers** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) to see if it's browser-specific
- [ ] **Compare dev vs production** - run `npm run dev` and `npm run build` separately to isolate the issue

### 2. Vite Build Configuration Issues
- [ ] **Check for import.meta usage** - The enhanced debug will show if the bundle contains `import.meta` which can cause issues in Tauri
- [ ] **Check for process.env usage** - Node.js globals can cause issues in browser environment
- [ ] **Verify base path** - Current config uses `base: './'` which should work, but verify
- [ ] **Test with absolute base path** - Try changing to `base: '/'` temporarily

### 3. Tauri Configuration Issues
- [ ] **Check CSP (Content Security Policy)** - The current CSP might be too restrictive
- [ ] **Verify asset serving** - Ensure Tauri is serving assets from the correct path
- [ ] **Check for path resolution issues** - The `tauri.localhost` domain might have path issues

### 4. Code Analysis
- [ ] **Check main.tsx** for any browser-incompatible code
- [ ] **Check App.tsx** for any issues that only appear in production builds
- [ ] **Look for dynamic imports** that might fail in production
- [ ] **Check for any Node.js specific code** that might be bundled

### 5. Build Process Debugging
- [ ] **Examine the built bundle** - Look at the actual `index-Bjs-JW7R.js` file content
- [ ] **Check for syntax errors** in the built JavaScript
- [ ] **Verify all dependencies** are properly bundled
- [ ] **Check for missing polyfills** that might be needed in production

### 6. Environment-Specific Issues
- [ ] **Test on different platforms** (Windows, macOS, Linux) if possible
- [ ] **Check Tauri version compatibility** with current Vite/React setup
- [ ] **Verify all Tauri dependencies** are up to date

### 7. Potential Solutions to Try

#### Solution A: Fix CSP Issues
```json
// In tauri.conf.json, try a more permissive CSP temporarily:
"csp": "default-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' tauri:; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' 'wasm-unsafe-eval' tauri:;"
```

#### Solution B: Fix Vite Base Path
```typescript
// In vite.config.ts, try:
base: process.env.TAURI_ENV ? './' : '/',
```

#### Solution C: Add Error Boundaries
```typescript
// Add error boundaries in React components to catch and display errors
```

#### Solution D: Check for Import Issues
- Look for any imports that might be failing in production
- Check for circular dependencies
- Verify all file paths are correct

### 8. Testing Steps
1. **Clean build**: `npm run clean && npm run build`
2. **Test minimal app**: Create a minimal React app to test if the issue is app-specific
3. **Compare bundle sizes**: Check if the production bundle is significantly different from dev
4. **Test asset loading**: Verify all assets (CSS, images) are loading correctly

### 9. Advanced Debugging
- [ ] **Use source maps** in production to get better error locations
- [ ] **Add more detailed logging** in the React components
- [ ] **Check for memory issues** that might cause the script to fail silently
- [ ] **Verify module format** - ensure ES modules are being used correctly

### 10. Common Tauri Issues
- **Asset path resolution**: Tauri might not be resolving relative paths correctly
- **Module loading order**: Some modules might be loading before dependencies
- **Browser compatibility**: Some modern JavaScript features might not be supported
- **File system access**: Any file system operations might fail in production

## Next Steps
1. Run the enhanced debug version to get more detailed error information
2. Check the browser console for specific error messages
3. Examine the built bundle content for syntax issues
4. Try the potential solutions in order of likelihood

## Expected Outcome
The enhanced debugging should reveal:
- Specific JavaScript error messages
- Whether the issue is CSP-related
- If there are Node.js globals in the bundle
- The exact point of failure in the module loading process
